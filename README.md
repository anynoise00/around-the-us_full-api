## About

A single page application where users can post photos and like photos uploaded by other users, made using React and Express.

This project is an improvement of the [Around React](https://github.com/anynoise00/around-react) project, it still uses React for the front-end, but now some routes are protected from users that are not logged in. The back-end was made using Express, and while doing it, I learned about CORS, JWT and password encryption.

This project was made for TripleTen's online web development bootcamp.
